# template-nuxt-3-docker

A reusable template based on Nuxt 3 - Docker ready.

Made to be used with the **[template-laravel-11-docker](https://github.com/E-IckArt/template-laravel-11-docker.git) repository**.

It just contains nuxt 3 and docker configurations files. Add nuxt modules and other tools to fit your needs.

As it's not in the project yet, create your own ``.env`` file.

To run the app on a Docker container :

````shell
npm install
docker compose up -d
````
